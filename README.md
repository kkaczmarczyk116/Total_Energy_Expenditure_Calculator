# Total Energy Expenditure Calculator
I really enjoy going to the gym, and I think it not only benefits your physical state, but also your mental state. I had a lot of people and friends ask me about my diet, and how much calories they should be eating to gain or lose weight. I had that many requests that I decided to make a tool/application to help those people. The application takes in the following data from the user and runs a custom algorithm(based on my knowledge at the gym) to calculator a 1-5 month schedule of the calories the user should be eating everyday to reach his/her goal. 
1. weight(lbs)
2. Height(FT/In)
3. Age
4. Gender
5. Activity Level
6. User's Goal
7. Duration

It also incorporates a GUI (PyQt5). This enables python to be used an alternative application development language to C++ on all supported platforms including iOS and android.
